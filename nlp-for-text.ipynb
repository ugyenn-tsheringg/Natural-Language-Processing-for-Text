    "# 1. Sentence Tokenization\n",
    "Sentence tokenization (also called sentence segmentation) is the problem of dividing a string of written language into its component sentences. The idea here looks very simple. In English and some other languages, we can split apart the sentences whenever we see a punctuation mark.\n",
    "However, even in English, this problem is not trivial due to the use of full stop character for abbreviations. When processing plain text, tables of abbreviations that contain periods can help us to prevent incorrect assignment of sentence boundaries. In many cases, we use libraries to do that job for us, so don’t worry too much for the details for now.\n",

    "Let’s look a piece of text about a famous board game called backgammon.\n",
    "> Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games. Its history can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archeological discoveries in the Middle East. It is a two player game where each player has fifteen checkers which move between twenty-four points according to the roll of two dice."

    "> Regular expressions use the backslash character ('\\') to indicate special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking their special meaning. This collides with Python’s usage of the same character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match a literal backslash, one might have to write '\\\\\\\\' as the pattern string, because the regular expression must be \\\\, and each backslash must be expressed as \\\\ inside a regular Python string literal.\n",
    "The solution is to use Python’s raw string notation for regular expression patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal prefixed with 'r'. So r\"\\n\" is a two-character string containing '\\' and 'n', while \"\\n\" is a one-character string containing a newline. Usually, patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw string notation.\n",

    "# Additional Notes on the Bag of Words Model\n",
    "![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/320/1*JvmcnIYVAzxHYdrxtmMa3Q.png)\n",
    "The complexity of the bag-of-words model comes in deciding how to design the vocabulary of known words (tokens) and how to score the presence of known words.\n",
    "Designing the Vocabulary\n",
    "When the vocabulary size increases, the vector representation of the documents also increases. In the example above, the length of the document vector is equal to the number of known words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, we can have a huge amount of data and in this cases, the length of the vector that represents a document might be thousands or millions of elements. Furthermore, each document may contain only a few of the known words in the vocabulary.\n",
    "Therefore the vector representations will have a lot of zeros. These vectors which have a lot of zeros are called sparse vectors. They require more memory and computational resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can decrease the number of the known words when using a bag-of-words model to decrease the required memory and computational resources. We can use the text cleaning techniques we’ve already seen in this article before we create our bag-of-words model:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ignoring the case of the words\n",
    "* Ignoring punctuation\n",
    "* Removing the stop words from our documents\n",
    "* Reducing the words to their base form (Text Lemmatization and Stemming)\n",
    "* Fixing misspelled words\n",
    "\n",
    "Another more complex way to create a vocabulary is to use grouped words. This changes the scope of the vocabulary and allows the bag-of-words model to get more details about the document. This approach is called n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "An n-gram is a sequence of a number of items (words, letter, numbers, digits, etc.). In the context of text corpora, n-grams typically refer to a sequence of words. A unigram is one word, a bigram is a sequence of two words, a trigram is a sequence of three words etc. The “n” in the “n-gram” refers to the number of the grouped words. Only the n-grams that appear in the corpus are modeled, not all possible n-grams."

    "The bag-of-bigrams is more powerful than the bag-of-words approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Scoring Words\n",
    "Once, we have created our vocabulary of known words, we need to score the occurrence of the words in our data. We saw one very simple approach - the binary approach (1 for presence, 0 for absence).\n",
    "Some additional scoring methods are:\n",
    "* Counts. Count the number of times each word appears in a document.\n",
    "* Frequencies. Calculate the frequency that each word appears in document out of all the words in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "# TF-IDF\n",
    "One problem with scoring word frequency is that the most frequent words in the document start to have the highest scores. These frequent words may not contain as much “informational gain” to the model compared with some rarer and domain-specific words. One approach to fix that problem is to penalize words that are frequent across all the documents. This approach is called TF-IDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF, short for term frequency-inverse document frequency is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus.\n",
    "The TF-IDF scoring value increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document, but it is offset by the number of documents in the corpus that contain the word.\n",
    "Let’s see the formula used to calculate a TF-IDF score for a given term x within a document y.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*V9ac4hLVyms79jl65Ym_Bw.png)\n",
